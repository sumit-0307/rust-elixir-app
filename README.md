# Rust-Elixir App

## Tech Stack that I used

### React on Frontend 
### Backend using Phoenix Framework of Elixir 
### Calculator using Rust and WASM (on the same react app)
### Text-to-Shader using Elixir and GLSL Shaders generated via Gemini API 
(I used Gemini cuz OFCOURSE its freee!)

Made all these stuffs in a hurry, with a lot of documentation, youtube tutorials, help from Chatgpt for Debugging and Gemini integration in elixir 

Deployed the Backend on render: https://elixir-backend-hs9d.onrender.com

And Frontend on Vercel: https://rust-elixir-app.vercel.app

If by any chance the shader isn't loading or giving any errors that prolly you need to give a detailed prompt of the glsl shader that you want because Gemini isn't trained or anything and works solely through the prompt given in the backend which can be misleading in some cases
